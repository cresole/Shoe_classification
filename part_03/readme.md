# Part 3

## Progress Report


1. The data is fully in hand by using Selenium to unblock 6pm.com
2. A full EDA is done on all of the shoe sole images with some pictures printed out in code
3. Still work on the labeling process and modeling process is not done yet.
4. The most difficult part is labeling 3400 images by hand. I initially did it by checking the website and putting the label in the spreadsheet and 200 images cost 2 hours which is unacceptable. Then I got help from some cohorts with dragging images to different folders. This sped up a lot. I am still working on this part.
      Another way to get away with this is to use unsupervised neural networks and here are a few websites related(I will try it after using supervised learning):

5. My capstone topic is the same as the starting point.
6. My timeline for next week and a half is to finish initial model building with both supervised learning and unsupervised learning and have a general idea about how the models work and how good my results could be.
7. During my 1:1, I discussed with Mark about the shoe shapes I chose and the criteria I used to distinguish the models. I still have the info piece by piece and they need to be integrated into my report/Jupyter Notebook.
