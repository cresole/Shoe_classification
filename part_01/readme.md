People have different foot shapes but shoe manufacturers donâ€™t have a standard to categorize their products for people to understand and choose easily.  Many people wear shoes those are not comfortable to them due to this or have to return their online purchases frequently which cost a lot of hassle in this busy working world. This project tries to categorize shoes based on their shapes for people with different foot shapes.
